# AB
A very low level language which compiles directly into readable TASM to run on DOSBOX

This project was started for learning about tasm, about assembly and about code translation.
~I'm very proud of it in it's current state and will keep updating it until it is usable!~

Not so much anymore lol. This is very old code and I learned a lot from the mistakes I made here and from the bad git usage.
The compiler here is very cool and supports all the basic features you would expect like variables, loops, ifs, functions
and a standard library. A couple of more advanced features are also supported like arrays, pointers and inline assembly.
Running code compiled by this compiler has only been tested with TASM and a Dos-Box VM.

## Downloads and dependencies
~You can download the .exe from [This link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VJPPnGVQNaFvDaarGW5-Mz5avbziCB5r?usp=sharing)~  
You can download the exe with the dlls in the releases tab.

To use it you have to download and install DOSBOX and TASM from the interwebs.
It would be easier to work with the compiler if your dosbox and tasm folder paths are as follows:

tasm: "C:\TASM", dosbox: "C:\Program Files (x86)\DOSBox-0.74-3\DOSBox.exe"

## Using The compiler 
Once you have downloaded it you need to have the .exe in a folder with the dlls and open the cmd there

Use command: 
`Asmb <file-name>` OR `Asmb <dosbox-path> <tasm-path> <file-name>` to compile the code and open it in dosbox. 

dosbox-path is the path to your dosbox.exe (defaults to "C:\Program Files (x86)\DOSBox-0.74-3\DOSBox.exe"), 
tasm-path is the path for your tasm folder where you put your .amb files (defaults to "C:\TASM"),
file-name is the path for the .ab you want to compile.

## Language and Syntax
Here is an example program: 
```
func void print(x byte) {
    push# x;
    ### 
        pop dx      
        mov ah, 2h 
        int 21h     
    ###
    return;
}

func byte read_char() {
    ret byte = 0;	
    ### 
        mov ah,00h      
        int 16h         
        mov ah, 0       
        push ax         
    ###
    pop# ret;
    return ret;
}

func byte main() {
  user_char byte;
  i byte = 10;
  
  user_char <- read_char(); 
  
  while i > 0 {
    print(user_char);
    i <- i - 1;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```
As you can see, this program takes a char and prints it 10 times. 
Note that when running this a 0 will be added because that's the exit code.

This is translated into:
```
mov ax, @data
mov ds, ax
call main
pop dx
mov ah, 2
add dl, '0'
int 21h
exit:
        mov ax, 4C00h

        ;       return

This is not the best translation but the translator will be improved 

#### The language itself has many constructs: 
while, if-else (no regular if yet..), variables (declared at top of function), 
4 different sizes (byte, word, dword and void), assembly interop, parameters and return values and more.

`###` is used for interop. For example, `### mov ax, 0 ###` would move 0 to ax. And `push# var` would push `var` to the stack. 

Using this you can copy and paste assembly right into your program and use `int` instructions.

You can also use the +, -, *, /, % operators as you would in any language and also =, !=, >=, >, <=, < (note that it uses = and not ==).
The size of the expression for +, -, *, /, % is determined by the bigger size of both sides, and the size of =, !=, >=, >, <=, < is always byte.

Another feature is `pushpop` that allows you to store values and retrieve them later. 
For example after executing
```
pushpop var1, var2 {
  var1 <- read_char();
  var2 <- var1 + 1;
  print(var2);
}
```
the variables `var1` and `var2` will keep their original values.
